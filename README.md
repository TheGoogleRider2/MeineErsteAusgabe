A "Hello, World" program written in Infomatik-Klasse at school

I'd made two versions of this. The first is the original **Java** version which is very basic.
Later on i wanna try port it to **Python** so i could use it with my **TASCHENRECHNER!!**
My idea was this would be my version of the **Hello, World** program which i would try to write in every language.
