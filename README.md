A "Hello, World" program written in Infomatik-Klasse at school

I'd made two versions of this. The first is the original **Java** version which is very basic.
Later on i wanna try port it to **Python** so i could use it with my **TASCHENRECHNER!!**
My idea was this would be my version of the **Hello, World** program which i would try on everything.

(note: the reason i always put **Yamete kudasai** at the end of all of my codes is because **Yamete kudasai** means **Can you please stop it** so yeah :)
